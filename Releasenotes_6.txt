Built project in Eclipse using maven and further imported this project in Jarchitect by importing required jar files for building the project successfully. Included QA matrix anlaysis in file named ‘JArchitectAnalysisReport’ under Test Support folder. Added respective screenshots of main dashboard report and few more reports in folder JArchitectReport folder in the same location. Also included the screenshot of the settings of project properties which we have used to build the project successfully in Jarchitect in folder Tool Support.

2. Ran Emma for whole Weka project successfully analysed code coverage for classifier module. Created Emma coverage report 'Emma Coverage Report.docx' included in Test Support folder which contains detailed analysis and interpretation of the result. Also found out how to generate html report 'EmmaReport.html' of the result generated by Emma in eclipse included same in the folder

3. Ran FindBugs for the project and analyzed the bugs generated by the FindBugs. Most of the FindBugs warnings generated differ with respect to data type and relate to multi thread checking. Comparing them to manual inspection done at the beginning, the bugs detected are not detected by FindBugs as the analysis done for by FindBugs at a different level.

4. Project Proposal: Limited the scope of STAF which we are unable to move forward due to less documentation support by STAF/STAF for test automation and difficulty of interpreting test cases of such large SUT Weka.
