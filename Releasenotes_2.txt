Release 2 comments:

1. Preliminary test plan (15/15):
	- Great start on the test plan. 
	- For the next release, let's continue to update the test plan, and start integrating findings/test results, as well. Here are some instructions:
		* We will the same document to record the test-QA plan and associated findings. This document will include Master Test-QA plan (see section 8 of IEEE guidelines), Level test plans (see section 9), level test reports (section 16) and master test report (section 17)
		* Master test - QA plan = include all activities/test levels as per YOUR project goals, tools, techniques etc...(again, see section 8). 
		* Level test plans will include information on each level/activity (for example, unit testing, system testing, static analysis etc; if you are using tools for part of the testing, you don't have to duplicate them in the document. Just point to the tool (or in your case...the weka test suite)..and include appropriate description in the document. 
		* Level test report (see section 16) - include results and findings as and when you complete a goal (if results are from a tool or in the form of a report, point to the report/resource, and include analyses and interpretations, as you see fit). 
		* Master test report - tie all the results in individual levels/activities and provide overall evaluation of the SUT(s); see section 17. 
		* You don't have to create all of this for the next release. These instructions are meant to guide your documentation throughtout the project and allow for effective focus on test/QA activities. 


2. Progress (20/20):
	- Nice work getting the SUT and suite up and running! 
	- Accepted all changes in the proposal. 
	- Don't have to create a folder for each release. Use following guidelines instead. 
	- Create "test support" folder and move all the reports, snap shots etc into that folder (this way,it is easy to refer/point to them in your test-plan document). 
	- Create "tool support" folder and move all instructions such as tool usage instructions into that folder

Release 2

Title: Weka – Java Code Testing

Team Members:
Kshitija Joshi     # M08766983
Mohammed Aamer FNU # M08802120
Instructor: Prof. Vignesh Subbian

1. Successfully built weka-stable-3.6.10 source code in Eclipse Helios with Java 1.6. Executed test cases for three modules namely Classifiers, Associations, Attribute selection with number of test cases 2267, 228, 1068 respectively. Included the analysis of execution of those test cases in Test_Plan_Weka.doc

2. Planning to follow the test plan referring to IEEE Standard for Software and System Test Documentation. Created a test plan document for the same. Included file in the repository. Test plan will be updated as the project progresses.

3. Also made few changes in proposal about more precised number of test cases and modules we are going to perform analysis on. Also changed QA metrics and purpose of using STAF in out testing plan.

4. Created basic plan of testing of modules we are going to conduct in Tarantula which can help to generate reports of execution of test cases we are going to analyse in future:
1. Requirements: Briefly, created requirements for the modules which we are going conduct the analysis.
2. Test cases: Created test cases for various test suites for that specific module. Linked those test cases to respective requirements.
3. Test Objects: Created test objects for respective test suites
