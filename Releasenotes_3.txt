Release 3 comments: 

1. Overall, good progress.While this is sufficient for this release, your team should interpret each of the results (the snapshots/text files by themselves don't mean anything), as suggested in your release notes below, and provide meaningful results for the final release. 

2. For release 4 in-class presentation, your team may demonstrate results you have so far.  See project deliverables write-up for more information on release 4. 

3. Create "test support" folder and move all the reports, snap shots etc into that folder (this way,it is easy to refer/point to them in your test-plan document). Create "tool support" folder and move all instructions such as tool usage instructions into that folder. 

4. Test plan looks good. If possible, combine master and level test plans into a single document.
